				<h2>Dissertation Project: Final Dissertation</h2>
    <table>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>The final stages of the project are worth 100% of your
            final mark, much of which rides on the quality of the final
            dissertation. Submitting drafts of your work to your
            supervisor well in advance of final deadlines can be
            rewarding.<br>
            <h3>Dissertation</h3>
            <p>Material from your earlier survey and analysis stage
              report should be organically integrated into the final
              dissertation. Modifications will be made to it based on
              feedback from your supervisor, but also, the deeper
              understanding you will have developed through your own
              developments and analysis of your results means that you
              will be able to produce a better-analysed literature
              survey (or other type of survey). Likewise, the analysis
              and requirements chapter will reflect your greater
              understanding.</p>
            <p> The contents of the dissertation (excluding references
              and appendices etc., with the font size being 11 or 12 pt)
              must be <b>between 7000 and 14000 words in length for COM3610
                and between 6000 and 12000 words for COM3500</b>. </p>
            <p> Dissertations come in a variety of types so it is
              difficult to generalize but the following pages:&nbsp;</p>
            <ul>
              <li><a href="http://www.dcs.shef.ac.uk/intranet/teaching/public/projects/diststructure.html">Dissertation structure</a></li>
              <li><a href="http://www.dcs.shef.ac.uk/intranet/teaching/public/projects/style.html">Dissertation writing style</a></li>
              <li><a href="http://www.dcs.shef.ac.uk/intranet/teaching/public/projects/references.html">Dissertation references</a></li>
            </ul>
            <p>should help you get started. Please  remember that if you are
              unsure what to do you should discuss the problem with your
              supervisor. <br>
            </p>
            <p>Be very careful to <a href="http://www.dcs.shef.ac.uk/intranet/teaching/public/projects/submission.html">submit</a> your work on time. If you do not, <a href="http://www.dcs.sheffield.ac.uk/intranet/teaching/public/assessment/latehandin.html">standard lateness penalties</a> will apply which could have a significant impact on your work. </p>
            <p>You must include the declaration in your work.<br>
            </p>
            <h3>Assessment</h3>
            The dissertation will be examined by both supervisor and
            second examiner and, in some cases, by a third examiner. The
            supervisor and second examiner will mark the final
            dissertation independently but only your supervisor marks
            your <a href="http://www.dcs.shef.ac.uk/intranet/teaching/public/projects/performance.html">performance on the project</a>.
            Exceptionally you may be called to attend a viva for the
            project which will be held before the end of semester 2.
            This could be for a number of reasons, e.g. the Department
            wishes to sample the cross-section of projects, there is a
            problem with the project, the examiners need to question
            certain things about the dissertation, etc.
            <p>The categories listed below are included on the
              assessment form that each examiner will complete. Also
              included below is a table that gives an <i>indication</i>
              of what is being looked for in the overall work - note
              however that this is only a <i>guide</i>.</p>
            <ul>
              <li> <b>Quality of products</b>: This covers the results
                of the work, whether these be software or hardware
                systems, models of systems, mathematical theorems and
                conjectures, etc. Judgements will be made on the basis
                of the complexity or difficulty of the task and the
                degree of success achieved.</li>
              <li> <b>Quality of processes</b>: This covers the
                processes involved in the development of the project
                work and can include the initial analysis of the problem
                with its theoretical foundations. It will also cover
                design and testing processes, and how you handled
                relevant legal, social or ethical issues. The use of the
                literature, and of available tools and methodologies
                will also be assessed here.</li>
              <li> <b>Amount of work completed</b>: somewhat
                self-descriptive. This category includes (i) the
                background learning you had to do which is distinct from
                the final products that were produced or the processes
                that were undertaken in producing the products, and (ii)
                the amount of work done in relation to what could be
                reasonably expected to be done on the particular
                project, given its level of difficulty and the time
                available.</li>
              <li> <b>Quality of evaluation</b>: This concerns your own
                evaluation of the project in terms of how well the
                objectives were satisfied, how appropriate the processes
                turned out to be, the possible further directions of
                study and the relationships with other people's work.</li>
              <li> <b>Presentation of dissertation</b>: The readability
                of the dissertation and the precision of its language
                will be judged here, along with the overall
                presentation: sensible notation, diagrams, layout,
                headings, references, etc.</li>
              <li> <b>Presentation Session</b>: <a href="http://www.dcs.shef.ac.uk/intranet/teaching/public/projects/poster.html"> See
                  the Presentation Session page</a><br>
              </li>
            </ul>
            The following list gives an <i>indication</i> of what is
            being looked for in the overall work. Note however that this
            is only a <i>guide</i>.

                    sections to produce a coherent and well-balanced
                    report. Good introduction chapter that puts the case
                    for the project and its aims. Review is well
                    researched. Thorough understanding of subject.
                    Focussed on topic. Factually correct. Addresses
                    issues critically. Analysis of problem area is
                    in-depth and requirements of project are clear.
                    Project evaluation is addressed with insight and
                    testing is properly covered. Design is precise,
                    methodical and shows some flair. Implementation and
                    testing is thorough and and pertinent points are
                    discussed. Results are presented in a logical order
                    with perceptive and critical discussion and
                    evaluation. Discussion of further work is
                    appropriate to the evaluation of work done.
                    Conclusions are correct and show ability to
                    summarise with acumen. Diagrams/maths/tables should
                    be relevant and clearly presented. Unambiguous and

                        originality and with some further work could be
                        of publishable quality. </li>
                      <li><i>90-100</i>: indicates originality and work

                    introduction that generally makes the project aims
                    clear. Review shows some evidence of research. Good
                    understanding of subject. Predominantly focussed on

                    addressing issues of testing and evaluation. Design
                    generally shows clarity. Implementation and testing
                    covers the main points, but may not be particularly
                    thorough. Main results are presented, although some
                    irrelevant material may be included. Discussion
                    shows some critical abilities. Further work is
                    perhaps a little over general. Conclusions are
                    competently covered. Diagrams/maths/tables should be

                    are generally competent but do not demonstrate real
                    depth in thinking. Further work is perhaps over
                    general or not particularly insightful. Conclusions
                    may ramble in parts. Some use of
                    diagrams/maths/tables, but may be poorly organised.
                    Clearly written overall, but may be ambiguous in
