            <p> Throughout the year, your supervisor will be watching
              how you perform on the dissertation project. When he/she
              is marking your work, the categories below will be used to
              judge your performance. </p>
            <p> You should use the categories below to influence your
              behaviour during your third year. Ask yourself if you are
              demonstrating these things to your supervisor. As an
              example, you could create a web site that gives a <em>brief</em>
              description of your project and maintians a weekly diary
              to show that you are putting in the required, continual
              effort on the project. As another example, you should be
              prepared for meetings with your supervisor - bring a list
              of ideas/questions/results to discuss. </p>
