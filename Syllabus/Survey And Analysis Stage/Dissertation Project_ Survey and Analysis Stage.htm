				<h2>Dissertation Project: Survey and Analysis Stage</h2>
    <table>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>
            <p>Towards the end of the first semester of your 3rd year
              you have to submit a preliminary report on your project. Failure to submit a satisfactory report will result in disciplinary   action, and referral under terms of progress of students regulations.   Where instances of plagiarism are detected in the survey and analysis   report, students will be required to attend a viva following the   submission of their dissertation.              </p>
            <p>The main component of this report will be an extensive
              literature survey (or similar technology/mathematical
              survey for certain types of project). In addition, the
              report should contain a clear presentation of what the
              project is aiming to achieve and a description of the work
              done so far. You will receive feedback from your
              supervisor and second marker, which will help you to
              prepare your final dissertation. Much of what is written
              for this report will probably be reused in a modified form
              in the final dissertation.&nbsp; It is expected that the
              project will be well under way at this stage. Many
              potential pitfalls can be avoided if you submit a draft of
              your report to your supervisor two weeks before the handin
              date. </p>
            <h3>Report Structure</h3>
            <p>For students taking COM3610 the report should be between 3000 and 6000 words. Students taking COM3500 should submit
              a report between 2500 and 5000 words.&nbsp; In either case the
              word limit does not include references and appendices
              etc., with the font size being 11 or 12 pt.</p>
            <p> There are many different types of project and so it is
              difficult to produce a detailed set of recommendations to
              suit every single report. The structure given below
              is only a suggestion, and your project supervisor will be able to give you further guidence on your own work. In general, all reports should be
              divided into a series of numbered chapters and sections,
              each with titles. Only the Chapters count towards the page
              limit.</p>

                  <td valign="middle">The introduction has several
                    purposes. Clearly one is to set the scene for the
                    project by giving a little relevant background
                    information - try to grab the reader's interest
                    early. Another is to clearly elucidate the aims and
                    objectives of the project and the constraints that
                    might affect the way in which the project is carried
                    out. If the project involves the solution of a
                    specific problem or the production of a specific
                    system this should be clearly specified in an
                    informal way. Finally, the introduction should
                    summarise the remaining chapters of the report, in
                    effect giving the reader an overview of what is to
                    come. </td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <th> Chapter 2: <br>
                    Literature Survey</th>
                  <td valign="middle"> Depending on the type of the
                    project, relevant literature may be hard to find,
                    and a technology survey/review of relevant
                    mathematics/review of similar software tools may be
                    more appropriate - you should discuss this with your
                    supervisor. <br>
                    A good literature survey should demonstrate your
                    awareness and understanding of the background
                    literature to your topic. It should begin by setting
                    the proposed research in a wide context, and
                    progress to a more detailed account of the most
                    relevant work in the area, taking care to include
                    some up-to-date references. Reviewing the literature
                    can help to identify questions and issues that have
                    not yet been answered, ideally questions that will
                    be addressed through your project. It may also be
                    appropriate to incorporate criticisms of previous
                    work, although you need to take care here that your
                    criticisms do not reflect a lack of understanding. <br>
                    Think of the review as writing an essay on the
                    background literature for your project. You should
                    not just provide a list of references followed by a
                    short summary of each of them. Instead the review
                    should be organised and structured in a meaningful
                    way, and the themes and relationships between the
                    references identified. You should expect to redraft
                    the review several times in order to arrive at a
                    text that is clearly written, easy to understand,
                    but that displays an in-depth understanding of the
                    topic. <br>
                    It is usual to assume that the reader is familiar
                    with first and second year course material. Any
                    further material needed should be summarised either
                    and suitable references cited. </td>

                    your project and analyse individual parts in detail.
                    The analysis may cover more than is finally
                    implemented. As a result of the analysis, you should
                    state what will be covered by the project and what
                    will not be done and why. Due consideration should
                    also be given to how you will evaluate your work.
                    Evaluation is one of the most important aspects of
                    any piece of work and it should be thought about in
                    the early stages. Consider tests or experiments that
                    can be conducted to establish the success of the
                    work. </td>

                    might be useful to others who wish to build on this
                    work, but that are not sufficiently important to the
                    project as a whole to justify being discussed in the
                    main body of the dissertation, then they could be
                    included as appendices, although this will be more
                    important for the final dissertation than for this
                    report. Any appendices do not count towards the page

                    examiners should read the appendices as part of the
                    assessment process. Hence, it is important that any
                    material which will be significant to judging the
                    quality of the report or of the project as a whole

            <p>This report will be examined by your supervisor and the
              second examiner independently. Your supervisor will then
              give detailed feedback, as well as an indicative mark, in
              a subsequent meeting with you. The purpose of the
              indicative mark is to provide you with an assessment of
              the quality of your work. If this feedback has not
              happened within two weeks of the start of semester 2,
              please contact the <a href="http://www.dcs.shef.ac.uk/cgi-bin/makeperson?Y.Gotoh">
                Project Officer</a>. The categories listed below are
              included on an assessment form that the supervisor and
              second examiner will complete. Also included below is a
              table that gives an indication of what is being looked for
              in the overall work - note however that this is only a
              guide. </p>

                  review of relevant mathematics / review of similar

                understand/synthesize/combine/evaluate/analyse/categorise
                relevant work is being considered here. </li>
              <li><i>Quality of overall work </i>(as ascertained from
                the report): This category mainly focuses on the
                analysis that has been done to date, and which should be
                complete for most projects. However, since for some
                types of project the analysis may be ongoing, this
                category looks at the work as a whole. </li>
              <li><i>Amount of work completed</i>: [somewhat
                self-descriptive] The amount of work done in relation to
                what could be reasonably expected to be done on the
                particular project, given its level of difficulty and
                the time available. </li>
              <li><i>Report presentation</i>: The readability of the
                report and the precision of its language will be judged
                here, along with the overall presentation: sensible
                notation, diagrams, layout, headings, references, etc. </li>
            </ul>
            Some of the questions that supervisor and second examiners
            will consider in marking the report are:
            <ul>
              <li> Is the project clearly defined? </li>
              <li>Are the objectives attainable? </li>
              <li>Does the student know what s/he is doing? </li>
              <li>Does the student have a clear understanding of what is
                still required in order to produce a satisfactory final
                dissertation? </li>
              <li>Is progress so far satisfactory? </li>
              <li>Does the literature survey synthesize information from
                several sources? </li>
              <li>Are sources suitably referenced and is the
                bibliography/list of citations adequate? </li>
              <li>Have potential problems and possible
                processes/tools/techniques been identified?</li>
              <li>Is the writing clear, precise and of the standard to
                be expected for a degree in science or engineering?</li>
              <li>Is the plan of action realistic? </li>
            </ul>
            <p> The following list gives an indication of what is being
              looked for in the overall work to date. Note however that
              this is only a guide.</p>

                    account. Good introduction chapter that puts the
                    case for the project and its aims. Review is well
                    researched. Thorough understanding of subject.
                    Focussed on topic. Factually correct. Addresses
                    issues critically. Analysis of problem area is
                    in-depth and requirements of project are clear.
                    Project evaluation is addressed with insight and
                    testing is properly covered. Diagrams/maths/tables
                    should be relevant and clearly presented.
                    Unambiguous and grammatically correct English.
                    Perfection is not essential. Some originality or
                    innovation. 80-89: indicates that the work has some
                    originality and with some further work could be of
                    publishable quality. 90-100: indicates originality
                    and work of publishable quality. </td>

                    introduction that generally makes the project aims
                    clear. Review shows some evidence of research. Good
                    understanding of subject. Predominantly focussed on

                    irrelevant material. Analysis is generally good and
                    project requirements are clear. Decent attempt at
                    addressing issues of testing and evaluation.
                    Diagrams/maths/tables should be relevant and clearly

                    generally ok. Review is competent but generally
                    exhibits a basic understanding of the subject.

                    be poorly organised. Clearly written overall, but

            <p>In addition your supervisor will also be continually
              judging your <a href="http://www.dcs.shef.ac.uk/intranet/teaching/public/projects/performance.html">performance on
                the project</a>. </p>
            <p> If either examiner has concerns about the report, it
              may be necessary to hold a viva. This is likely when
              progress on the project has been slow, and/or the
              indicative mark is lower than 40%. It might also be held
              if there are problems with the direction of the project,
              and the student's attitude towards the work. In all cases
              the viva will normally be held before the end of Semester
              1, probably during the Semester 1 exam period. </p>
            <h3>Submission</h3>
            <p>You are required to submit the report electronically through MOLE by the deadline. You must include the declaration in your work. </p>
