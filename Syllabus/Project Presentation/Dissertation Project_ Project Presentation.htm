				<h2>Dissertation Project: Project Presentation</h2>
    <table>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>
            <p>The purpose of the project presentation  session is to allow you to demonstrate your ability, both in writing and  orally, to describe your project and explain its main findings to others who  have no previous knowledge of it. </p>
            <p>You will be allocated a station with two  computers in the Diamond.&nbsp; You can use  one for the project presentation, and one for a demo of your project (if  appropriate).&nbsp; To present your project,  choose one of the following methods:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>&nbsp;A one-page  information sheet, like a poster, to be displayed on a computer screen.</li>
              <li>A short set of PowerPoint (or Keynote) slides (maximum  of 5).</li>
              <li>A video</li>
            </ol>
            <p>The presentation should include a brief  description of the project, and a summary of its main findings. It is expected  that the presentation should provide a fairly graphic presentation of the main  features of your project, getting in the key ideas across clearly, without  getting lost in the detail. A diagram can be illuminating and attention  grabbing. The text should be made large enough so that people can read it with  ease.&nbsp; Sensible use of colour can be a  great eye-catcher. Do not present a dense wall of text â€“ it is better to summarise  and explain in greater detail when attendees ask questions. The presentation should  be interesting enough to make people want to know more. <br>
            Note: Remember to include the project title  and your name. </p>
            <p>The aspects of the project that are  covered by the presentation should include the following:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>              The background to the problem that the  project was trying to solve;</li>
              <li>                The methods used to solve the problem  (which, if the project was mainly concerned with developing a piece of  software, should include the methods used for analysing the requirements, and  the methods or tools used for<br>
                designing and implementing the system);</li>
              <li>                The results obtained (which, if the  project was mainly concerned with developing a piece of software, should  include the results of testing the system, and the extent to which all of the  requirements were met); and</li>
              <li>              Any conclusions that can be drawn from  the project.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If you have developed some software you  would normally demonstrate it at the project presentation. The software demonstration  should be organised. Interactivity is always valued, but make sure you have  some pre-canned aspects that you can initially use to explain your project or  to fall back on if the interactive demo does not work. Make sure it is easy to  launch with little or no waiting time.&nbsp;  If your project requires the use of specialist hardware loaned from the  department, e.g. NAO robots, you will need to make sure you have arranged  access to this equipment for the presentation session well in  advance. If too many people request the same piece of hardware, you will be  allocated a time slot in which you will be able to use the equipment. The Admin Team will send out a call for requirements in August, please keep a look out for this in your emails and reply promptly.</p>
The project presentation session will take place in the Diamond Computer  Rooms 2 and 3. You will be allocated a  space nearer the time.&nbsp;
<h3>Attendance </h3>
            <p>Attendance at the project presentation  session is compulsory. It is part of the formal assessment for your  dissertation project.              Academic staff will be marking your  presentation session, asking you questions and assessing your performance.  There may also be some people from outside the Department, e.g. project clients  from other departments and visitors from            local companies.</p>
<h3>Assessment</h3>
            <p>You will be assessed on your ability to  summarise your work and present it professionally in an interesting manner. The  grade from the poster session will be factored into the overall grade for your  project, according to the mark sheets. </p>
            <p>Three areas will be focused on in the  assessment process:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>              The presentation itself: is it a good  summary, bold, colourful, attractive?</li>
              <li>                The software demonstration: it should  work (to whatever extent) and be usable by visitors;</li>
              <li>                Your oral explanations and  question-answering skills.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>In cases where the supervisor and second  marker are not able to attend the poster session, a separate meeting with the  supervisor and second marker will be arranged. During this meeting the  presentation and any software demonstration will be discussed and assessed.</p>
<h3>Checklist</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Are your name, the project title and your  supervisor's name clearly displayed in the presentation, and perhaps also your  MSc programme?</li>
              <li>                Does the presentation summarise the  aims/objectives of the project, the methods that were used, the results obtained  and the conclusions that you drew from them?</li>
              <li>                Does the software demonstration (if  appropriate) have a logical flow? Is it easy to launch (little or no waiting time),  and do you have preset demonstrations to show if the software crashes on the  day?            </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Attendees</h3>
            <p>As well as the academic staff, all sorts  of people attend the project presentation session including some people from  outside the Department, e.g. staff from other departments and visitors from  local companies. We expect you to be well-organised, clear and impressive.&nbsp; It is a good idea to prepare and practice a 5  minute oral presentation, although some visitors/assessors may prefer to  question you instead.</p>
